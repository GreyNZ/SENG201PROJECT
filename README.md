<html>TO DO <br/>
theres a bug where buying 0 items adds one to all<br/>
gui needs magic mushrooms<br/>
gui needs an end day button<br/>
make the new game screen work (more than just quickplay)<br/>
death function<br/>
another field in the trade tab showing how many of each item are already owned<br/>
update cash (after buying, after finding and on screen)<br/>
gui tweaks <br/>
make seperate healing/food data structures from the shopList dictionary<br/>
make it so crew members can be healed / fed <br/>
initGame has methods for getting plagued and pirated. make them work <br/>
make the sleep button do something<br/>
need a way to end the game, and a game over screen <br/>
make repair shields and hull work <br/><br/>
Cool but not super necessary things:<br/>
jlabels underneath 'use healing item' and 'select food'  that displays information about <br/>
the item when the combobox changes<br/> 
maybe 3 new windows to pop up for the random events<br/>
